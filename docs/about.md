# La mia biografia

## Education & Research Fields
I was born in May 1980 and graduated with honors in Industrial Design from the Luigi Vanvitelli Faculty of Architecture at the Second University of Naples. Over the years, I have developed my expertise across various sectors that integrate Binary Manufacturing, either fully or partially, within production processes.

My research focuses on Industrial and Interaction Design, Parametric Design, and Digital Fabrication. I have held roles as a Product and Process Designer and as a Manager of Digital Fabrication Laboratories (FabLabs). I define myself as a Product Designer with a Maker's soul, blending code with design to create "form-finding projects" through computational design.

In 2017, I completed the international "Fab Academy" program, an intensive course on the applications and implications of digital design and fabrication, taught by Neil Gershenfeld, a professor at MIT's Center for Bits and Atoms and the founder of the first FabLab. Since 2017, I have served as a Fab Academy Instructor for Academany and FabFoundation.

## Extra Job Experience
Since late 2012, I have been the founder and director of FabLab Napoli, the only southern Italy node for the local teaching of the Fab Academy program, coordinated by the FabFoundation and FabLab Barcelona. As the coordinator and Lab Manager of FabLab Napoli, I am the reference point for various national projects, particularly those focused on peer education and STEAM fields.

I also work as a consultant for digital manufacturing technologies and applications for major Italian companies, primarily in research and development and training.

Since 2014, I have been a certified and authorized trainer by McNeel for teaching Rhinoceros and Grasshopper (ART - Authorized Rhino Trainer).

## My Job
Since 2015, I have taught Interaction Design and Digital Fabrication at the Academy of Fine Arts in Naples, and since 2021, I hold a professorship in Interactive Systems (ABTEC42), affiliated with the Department of New Technologies of Art.
